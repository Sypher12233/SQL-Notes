# SQL #

* If you want your web application to store, retrieve and modify data like usernames, passwords, payment information and more, you need to use **SQL**

* SQL stands for **S**tructured **Q**uery **L**anguage

* SQL is a language that Data Scientists and Data Analysts use to query and analyze data

* SQL stores information in tables, which is simply a collection of information organized into rows and columns

* Here’s an example of a query that would select all of the columns —the * keyword is a shorthand for “all”— from the page_views table:

```SQL
SELECT * FROM page_views;
```

* Web developers and software engineers also use SQL to build apps that can save, modify and access data
